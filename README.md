# Translator Discord BOT Deepl

This Discord bot performs translations using the [Deepl API](https://www.deepl.com/en/products/api).
You can translate using slash commands, context menu commands, and flag reactions to messages.

The translation can be done by automatically detecting the source language or by selecting it.

The translation carried out using the reaction with the flags of the nations is available for 97 nations.

Thanks to Deepl APIs, 35 different languages are currently available, and if new languages are added, they will be implemented automatically.
